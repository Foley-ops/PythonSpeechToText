# PythonSpeechToText
## Purpose
A speech to text program that can be used on any computer to transcribe conversations and save them into text/document files.  The goal of this app/program is so that people who are deaf/hard of hearing can chat with people on programs like zoom, discord, and other video chat platforms.

## Functionality
The functionality I'm looking for is essentially closed captioning, but instead of the words just showing up on the screen I want it to be in a word/text document of some sort so the user can reread the text and can distinguish when different people are saying things.
